# Treasury Management

At the time of this writing, MolochDAO has a substantial treasury that is only being depleated.  If the DAO is to continue to fund public goods, a committee or guild will need to manage and replenish the treasury.  Anyone intersted in this task is encouraged to make it known in the Discord.  Please reach out to a ReallyBoringGuild member in the get-involved channel.
