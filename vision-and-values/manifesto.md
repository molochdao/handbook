# Manifesto

### What MolochDAO is _not_

1. **MolochDAO is not a company.** It does not have a board. There is no CEO, there is no team of managers. There is no room for bureaucrats.
2. **MolochDAO does not have investors.** Decisions are not based on quarterly earnings.  No one is receiving dividends.  There's no elite few, pulling the strings in the background.
3. **MolochDAO does not cater to speculators.** Pump it, dump it, hedge it, short it, long it, lend it, nobody cares. MolochDAO is agnostic to price.
4. **MolochDAO does not have centralized public relations.** There’s no legal entity, there’s no foundation, no copyright, no patent, no central authority to stamp announcements with official seals from some great leader.

### What MolochDAO _is_

1. **MolochDAO is Ethereum. We believe Ethereum is not the perceived Ponzi scheme, riding the coattails of cypherpunk. This infrastructure is changing the world and we will break our backs to keep it running.
2. **MolochDAO stands for Ethereum as a digital public good that will someday facilitate protecting and nurturing our material public goods. Ethereum is the gwei.
3. **MolochDAO is punk as fuck.** Kill yr idols, practice careful and critical civil disobedience, just say no to degenerates. We can take a punch to the face and still remain optimistic that we can manifest this world to be better, much better.&#x20;
4. **MolochDAO is constantly evolving.** What MolochDAO is today may not be what it is tomorrow. (If it is we are failing.) What you do after reading this may change Moloch forever. It’s up to you. 🤘🏽👹🤘🏽
