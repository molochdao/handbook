# Compensation

**Rates**

* A new contributor begins at the base rate of 50/hr for the first 6 months or until the equivalent of 1 MolochDAO share is reached (=.4987 ETH at the time of this writing)
* After the introductory period, the initiate may request an evaluation of their work by other ReallyBoringGuild and/or MolochDAO members. If they are deemed a valuable contributor, their compensation rate will increase to 75/hr and they may be invited to submit a membership proposal to the DAO, along with a tribute amount equivalent to one MolochDAO share.



**Status Updates**

On the first Monday of the month, each RBG contributor will have submitted payment requests, via Github, for the previous month.  These requests will include expenses and time, with associated summaries and documents.&#x20;



#### Payment Requests

* Payment requests should be submitted by 08:00PST on the first Monday of the month for the prior month's work. This will include the total number of hours worked in the pay period. Payment will be distributed at the monthly RBG multisig meeting that **occurs on the first Tuesday of every month**.&#x20;
* The payout threshold is 1000 DAI or the equivalent in ETH. Contributors that earn less than 1000 DAI will have their payments carried over into the next pay period. In the event that a contributor resigns from the RBG before reaching the 1000 DAI payment threshold they should make note of this status change in their final payment request to avoid delays.&#x20;
* Contributors have the choice to be paid in DAI or ETH, depending on the current treasury holdings. Hourly rates are determined in DAI. The ETH exchange rate is determined by current market values at the time of payment transfer, subject to the volatility of ETH.&#x20;
* Payment requests are reviewed by a member committee that has been delegated to the RBG multi-sig.

#### Value Level

Ideally, compensation is based on expected value delivered to MolochDAO. This is a fuzzy concept which does not and should not have a precise definition. At the moment, rates are expected to remain as they are, for all contributors, to keep operational costs at a minimum.  Although, discussion on this topic is welcome, as we want to incentivize the greatest minds to participate.
