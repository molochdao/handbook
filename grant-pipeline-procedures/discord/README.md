# Discord

You can join the Discord [here](https://discord.gg/bhqd3D6B).&#x20;

If you have been assigned a <mark style="color:red;">@MolochDAO Member</mark> role, then you will be able to access all of MolochDAO’s internal channels. If you have received a grant from the DAO in the form of shares but have not yet received your Discord role, make it know in the Discord, #landing-pad or #townhall-chat channels.

If you haven't already introduced yourself and would like to contribute to the DAO, the first place you’ll want to make yourself known is #get-involved - where you can introduce yourself, your hobbies and your strengths.
