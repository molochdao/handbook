### Haus Bot <a href="haus-bot" id="haus-bot"></a>

This bot is operating on MolochDAO discord notification channels in order to keep track of incoming member proposals. It contains variables such as:

* the name fo the proposal
* a short description of the proposal
* the amount of member shares
* the tribute amount of WETH
* the funding amount
* the amount of loot shares

A link on the panel redirects you to the proposal on app.daohaus.club, where you can see all the details and the actions taken upon it.

It is a notification bot that announces new DAO summons & proposals

Three cheers to MolochDAO member vengist#8655 for creating the bot!
